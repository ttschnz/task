# task-bridge
a simple bridge for taskwarrior to ubuntu subsystem on windows.

## installation 
```
npm i -g git+https://github.com/ttschnz/task.git#master
```
for some reason it opens the .js file in an editor instead of running it via node

## usage
1. open cmd
2. use task command as if you were in the ubuntu subsystem
